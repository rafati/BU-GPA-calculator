Okay, here is a consolidated summary of the requirements for the Bethlehem University GPA Calculator, reflecting all the logic discussions and decisions, particularly the final refined logic for the Target GPA calculation (based on v34). This document should serve as a comprehensive reference.
Version 0.1.14

**--- Consolidated Requirements: Bethlehem University GPA Calculator (v34 Logic) ---**

**1. Purpose & Goal**

*   **Primary Goal:** To provide Bethlehem University students (identified via Google Login) with a tool to:
    *   View their current official cumulative GPA (Overall and Major) based on administrative records.
    *   Load their recent/current course registrations into an interactive calculator/planner interface.
    *   Modify this planner data (edit courses, add hypothetical courses, remove courses) for planning and "what-if" analysis according to Bethlehem University's grading policies.
    *   Calculate the GPA for the courses currently in the planner interface based on selected grades.
    *   Calculate the projected Cumulative Overall and Major GPAs based on their official cumulative data plus the state of the planner.
    *   **Automatically** calculate the required average Semester GPA needed across relevant courses listed in the planner (those expected to receive a GPA-affecting grade) to achieve user-defined target Cumulative GPAs (defaulting to 2.0).
*   **Secondary Goals:**
    *   Provide a flexible planning tool starting from actual registration data.
    *   Help students understand the potential impact of grade changes or adding/dropping courses.

**2. Target Audience**

*   **Primary Users:** Enrolled students at Bethlehem University whose email addresses are listed in the master Google Sheet (`Students` tab) and who use the corresponding `@bethlehem.edu` Google account to log in.

**3. Scope**

*   **In Scope:**
    *   User Authentication via Google OAuth, restricted to the `@bethlehem.edu` domain.
    *   Data Retrieval (Read-Only) from Google Sheets: `Students` (cumulative), `registration` (courses), `Gradescale` (rules).
    *   Displaying official Cumulative Data and calculated GPAs (applying Points/10 rule from `Students` sheet).
    *   Pre-populating an editable course planner list using data from `registration`. Saving initial state for reset.
    *   Allowing users to modify (Course ID, Credits, Grade, Major?, Repeat?), add (default 3 credits), and remove courses within the planner list (changes are temporary for the session).
    *   Handling data lookup failures (Student Not Found = start with 0 cumulative, disable repeats).
    *   Dynamically configuring grade point values and GPA inclusion rules based on the `Gradescale` sheet (using "Not Calcualted in GPA" note).
    *   Handling WF grade as equivalent to F (based on `Gradescale` data).
    *   Calculating "Semester Planner GPA" based only on planner courses with valid, GPA-affecting grades *currently selected*.
    *   Calculating "Projected Cumulative GPA" applying BU repeat rules (Grade Replacement: removing previous points for all repeats replacing GPA-grades; removing previous credits only for P-repeats).
    *   Input fields for Target Cumulative Overall/Major GPA (defaulting to 2.0).
    *   **Automatic calculation** (updating as inputs change) of "Required Semester GPA" needed across planner courses (excluding those with explicitly non-GPA grades like W,E,I,IP, non-repeat P) to reach the target cumulative GPA. Displaying points needed if relevant divisor credits are zero. Highlighting impossible required GPAs (>4.0/<0.0).
    *   Resetting the planner to its initial state.
    *   Displaying a configurable disclaimer message (text provided externally).
    *   User Logout.
    *   Modern, clean, responsive UI prioritizing mobile-first experience (English language only), with branding inspired by BU website/logo.
    *   **Space-efficient UI layout** that minimizes vertical scrolling, particularly on mobile devices, featuring:
        * Combined GPA Results section that displays both Semester Planner and Projected Cumulative GPAs in a single view
        * Compact mobile course entry display that fits all controls for a course in a minimal amount of vertical space
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Writing any data back to Google Sheets.
    *   Persistently saving user modifications made to the planner list between sessions.
    *   Automatically suggesting grades to achieve targets.
    *   Complex rule automation beyond specified repeat logic.
    *   User account management separate from Google.
    *   Localization (Interface is English only).
    *   Official academic record keeping or advising.

**4. Functional Requirements**

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** FR_AUTH1-FR_AUTH5 (As defined: Google Login @bethlehem.edu, Data Lookup, Failure Handling, Student Not Found Handling, Logout).
    *   **FR_AUTH1: Google Login:** Allow users to log in via Google OAuth, restricted to the `@bethlehem.edu` domain.
    *   **FR_AUTH2: Data Lookup:** Upon successful login, retrieve the user's email and look up their corresponding `DegStudentNo` in the `Students` sheet.
    *   **FR_AUTH3: Failure Handling:** Gracefully handle API errors during login or data fetch (e.g., network issues, invalid credentials).
    *   **FR_AUTH4: Student Not Found Handling:** If the logged-in user's email is not found in the `Students` sheet, initialize the calculator with 0 cumulative data and potentially disable repeat-specific features.
    *   **FR_AUTH5: Logout:** Provide a mechanism for the user to sign out, clearing their session and resetting the calculator state.
    *   **FR_AUTH7: Account Selection:** Configure Google authentication to always display the account selection screen, allowing users to choose from all available logged-in Google accounts.
*   **FR_AUTH6: Access Control & Student Selection:**
    *   The system will determine user access rights based on multiple sources, with permissions being cumulative across all roles:
        1.  **Advisor-based Access:** 
            *   If the authenticated user's email (or the override email, if active) is found in the `Advisor` column of the `Students` sheet, the user is authorized to access all students for whom they are listed as the advisor.
        2.  **Class Access Sheet-based Access:**
            *   The system will check a new `Class Access` sheet which contains the following columns:
                *   `FacEmail`: Faculty/staff email address
                *   `Department`: Department the faculty/staff belongs to (may be empty)
                *   `Faculty`: Faculty the user belongs to (may be empty)
                *   `AccessAllStudents`: If "Yes", grants access to all students in the system
                *   `Student`: Contains specific student IDs the user should have access to (may be empty)
            *   Access determination logic (permissions are cumulative across all applicable rules):
                *   If `AccessAllStudents` is "Yes", the user has access to all student records in the system
                *   If specific `Student` IDs are listed, the user has access to those specific students
                *   If `Department` is specified, the user has access to all students who belong to that department
                *   If `Faculty` is specified, the user has access to all students who belong to that faculty
    *   Once access rights are determined:
        *   The system will create a unified list of all students the user has access to from all roles
        *   If the user has access to multiple students, the application must present an interface for searching and selecting a specific student to load in the calculator
        *   The search interface should allow typing a partial student ID and suggest matching students as they type
        *   Once a valid student is selected, the calculator will load that student's cumulative data and course registrations
    *   If the user has no access to any student records through any of these roles, the "Student Not Found" handling (FR_AUTH4) applies.
*   **Data Handling & Configuration:** FR_DATASRC1, FR_CONFIG1, FR_DATA_FRESHNESS, FR_DATA_MISMATCH (As defined: Secure read-only Sheets access, Load/Cache `Gradescale`, Frequent student data reads, Ignore `RegGrade` not in `Gradescale`).
*   **Display:** FR_DISPLAY1-FR_DISPLAY7 (As defined: Base Cum Data+GPA(Points/10), Planner Table, Semester GPA+Credits, Projected Cum GPA+Credits, Target GPA inputs & Auto-Calculated Required GPA/Points, Configurable Disclaimer).
*   **FR_DISPLAY8: Optimized UI Layout:** 
    *   **FR_DISPLAY8.1: Combined GPA Results:** Display both Semester Planner GPA and Projected Cumulative GPA in a single, unified section to minimize vertical space usage while maintaining all relevant information.
    *   **FR_DISPLAY8.2: Compact Mobile Course Display:** Provide a space-efficient mobile layout for course entries that uses a grid layout to organize all course controls (ID, credits, grade, major/repeat checkboxes) in minimal vertical space.
*   **FR_DISPLAY9: GPA Results Card:**
    *   **FR_DISPLAY9.1: Tab Navigation:** Implement a tab-based interface with three tabs: Semester, Projected, and Target.
    *   **FR_DISPLAY9.2: Consistent Formatting:** Format all GPA values to display exactly three decimal places.
    *   **FR_DISPLAY9.3: Credit Display:** Display all credit values as whole numbers without decimal places.
    *   **FR_DISPLAY9.4: Tab-Specific Footers:**
        * **Semester Tab Footer:** Display "Projected: CUM/Major" and "Target: CUM/Major" values.
        * **Projected Tab Footer:** Display "Semester: CUM/Major" and "Target: CUM/Major" values.
        * **Target Tab Footer:** Display "Semester: CUM/Major" and "Projected: CUM/Major" values.
    *   **FR_DISPLAY9.5: Negative Value Handling:** Display negative GPA or points values in red text.
    *   **FR_DISPLAY9.6: Target Tab Cards:** Display dedicated cards showing "Required Semester GPA" and "Required Semester Major GPA" with credits information.
        * Include "Based on X semester credits and Y total credits" under each GPA value.
        * Show "points" suffix when displaying point values instead of GPA.
    *   **FR_DISPLAY9.7: Warning Messages:** Display appropriate warning messages when:
        * Overall or Major GPA is above 4.0 (impossible to achieve)
        * Semester credits are 0 (no courses with grades that affect GPA)
        * Do not show warnings for negative GPA/points values
*   **Planner Functionality:** FR_POPULATE1, FR_INTERACT1-FR_INTERACT7 (As defined: Populate from sheet & save initial state, Editable fields, Conditional Previous Grade/Original Major inputs, State updates via handlers, Add/Remove/Reset buttons).
*   **Calculations:**
    *   **FR_CALC_SEMESTER:** Calculates Semester GPA based only on planner courses with currently selected GPA-affecting grades. Divisor = Credits of courses with selected GPA-affecting grades.
    *   **FR_CALC_PROJECTED:** Calculates Projected Cum GPA. Uses base data adjusted by removals (points for all repeats, credits for P-repeats) plus net changes (points based on grade difference for repeats, credits only for non-repeats).
    *   **FR_CALC_TARGET (v34 Logic):** Automatically calculates Required Semester GPA based on Target Cum GPA inputs and planner state. Logic Summary:
        1.  Identify relevant planner courses (exclude W,E,I,IP and non-repeat P).
        2.  Calculate `AdjustedBasePoints/Credits` (Base - P-repeat credits/points - *all* relevant repeat points).
        3.  Calculate `NetCreditsAddedByPlanner` (only non-repeats from relevant courses).
        4.  Calculate `FinalCumulativeCredits` (`AdjustedBaseCredits` + `NetCreditsAddedByPlanner`).
        5.  Calculate `TotalPointsNeeded` (`TargetCumulativeGPA` * `FinalCumulativeCredits`).
        6.  Calculate `RequiredSemesterPoints` (`TotalPointsNeeded` - `AdjustedBasePoints`).
        7.  Calculate `SemesterDivisorCredits` (from relevant courses: sum credits if grade is blank OR grade `AffectsGPA`).
        8.  If `SemesterDivisorCredits` > 0, `RequiredSemesterGPA` = `RequiredSemesterPoints` / `SemesterDivisorCredits`.
        9.  Else, output `RequiredSemesterPoints` needed over 0 GPA credits.
        10. Format output string including divisor credits. Handle Overall/Major separately.
*   **FR_TARGET_DISPLAY: Target GPA Analysis Display Format:**
    *   **FR_TARGET_DISPLAY1: Layout Structure:**
        * Use a dedicated section with the heading "Target GPA Analysis" separated by a horizontal line in reports.
        * Display Overall and Major GPA targets and requirements side-by-side in two equal columns.
        * Include detailed credit information beneath each required GPA value.
    
    *   **FR_TARGET_DISPLAY2: Content Requirements:**
        * **Target Values:** Display target GPAs with exactly three decimal places (e.g., "2.000").
        * **Required Values:** Show required semester GPAs in purple text with three decimal places.
        * **Credit Information:** 
            * Both print and PDF formats must display identical information showing "Based on X semester credits and Y total credits" where X represents applicable semester credits and Y represents final cumulative credits after adjustments.
            * For Major GPA: Include the word "major" before "semester credits" and "total credits" (e.g., "Based on 13 major semester credits and 19 total major credits").
            * The exact same format and wording must be used consistently across all output formats.
        * **Points Display:** When divisor credits are zero, display "X.XX points needed" instead of a GPA value.
        * **Impossible Values:** Use red text and "> 4.000" for impossible GPA targets (requiring semester GPA above 4.0).
        * **Warning Text:** Include a red asterisk note: "* Major target GPA calculation requires major courses with grades that affect GPA."
    
    *   **FR_TARGET_DISPLAY3: Numerical Formatting:**
        * All GPA values must display exactly three decimal places.
        * Credit values must be displayed as whole numbers without decimal places.
        * Required GPA values use purple text (#800080) when possible, red text (#cc0000) when impossible.
        * The format must be identical across all generated outputs (screen, print, PDF).
*   **Sharing Functionality:**
    *   **FR_SHARE1: Generate Shareable Link:** Add a button or mechanism to generate a unique URL that encodes the current state of the calculator. This includes:
        *   Editable Base Cumulative Overall Credits
        *   Editable Base Cumulative Overall Points
        *   Editable Base Cumulative Major Credits
        *   Editable Base Cumulative Major Points
        *   The current list of `plannerCourses` (including course ID, credits, selected grade, major status, repeat status, previous grade, and original major status if applicable).
        *   Target Overall GPA Input
        *   Target Major GPA Input
        *   Student ID (DegStudentNo) if available (`sId`)
        *   Base Data Note from Students sheet (`bDN`)
    *   **FR_SHARE2: Load State from Link:** The application must be able to parse the data encoded in a shared link URL (when visited directly) and pre-populate the calculator with the corresponding values.
    *   **FR_SHARE3: No Authentication for Shared Link:** Accessing a shared link and interacting with the pre-populated calculator state should **not** require Google authentication. The user accessing the link operates independently of any logged-in session.
    *   **FR_SHARE4: Configurable Base URL:** The base URL used for generating the shareable link (e.g., `https://myapp.com/calculator?data=...`) must be read dynamically from a configuration source, specifically cell `B2` of the Google Sheet used for general configuration (likely the same sheet as the `Gradescale` or a dedicated `Config` sheet - *Clarify which sheet if necessary*).

        *   Timestamp indicating when the print was generated
    *   **FR_PRINT4: Print Styling:** The print layout must be clean, professional, and use appropriate font sizes and spacing to ensure readability while maintaining the single-page constraint.
    *   **FR_PRINT5: Print Preview:** When possible, provide a print preview dialog using the browser's native functionality.
    *   **FR_PRINT6: Responsive Print Layout:** The print layout must adjust appropriately to fit all required information on a single page regardless of the number of courses in the planner.
    *   **FR_PRINT7: Logo Integration:** The printed output must include the Bethlehem University logo in the header section of the document:
        *   The logo must be appropriately sized to maintain the single-page layout constraint
        *   The logo should be positioned in the top-left or top-center of the document
        *   The logo must maintain its aspect ratio and proper rendering quality
        *   Logo placement should not interfere with essential content visibility or readability
        *   If space constraints become an issue with many courses, the system should dynamically reduce the logo size rather than allowing content to flow to a second page
    *   **FR_PRINT8: Format Consistency with PDF:** The print output must exactly match the format and layout of the PDF output:
        *   The header layout must include the logo on the left with the "GPA Calculator Report" title and student ID to the right
        *   A horizontal line must separate the header from content, with Student ID and generation timestamp displayed above it
        *   Layout structure must follow the exact PDF format:
            * Top row with two equal columns: "Base Cumulative Data" and "Current Semester" (with "Projected Cumulative" below it)
            * Single row for "Target GPA Analysis" with side-by-side display of Overall and Major targets and requirements
            * "Course Planner" with course count displayed in parentheses
        *   The "Base Cumulative Data" section must display credits as whole numbers and GPA values with exactly three decimal places
        *   The "Current Semester" section must display GPA values in green with three decimal places
        *   The "Projected Cumulative" section must display GPA values in blue with three decimal places 
        *   The "Target GPA Analysis" section must display required GPA values in purple with three decimal places
        *   The disclaimer at the bottom must be identical to the PDF version, including:
            * A standard disclaimer about the calculator providing estimates
            * The special disclaimer text from cell C1 of the configuration sheet
            * "Page 1 of 1" displayed at the bottom right
        *   The entire output must fit on a single page regardless of the number of courses

*   **User Feedback Collection:**
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK1: Feedback Trigger:** Provide a clearly visible button or link (e.g., "Send Feedback") allowing users to initiate the feedback submission process.
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK2: Feedback Form:** Present a simple modal or form with a text area for the user to type their feedback.
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK3: Automatic Data Inclusion:** When submitting feedback:
        *   Automatically capture and include the authenticated user's email address.
        *   Automatically capture and include the currently selected Student ID (`DegStudentNo`), if one is loaded.
        *   *(Optional/Stretch Goal)* Attempt to capture a screenshot of the current calculator interface state and include it with the feedback. Investigate feasibility using client-side libraries (e.g., html2canvas).
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK4: Feedback Submission:**
        *   Package the user's text feedback along with the automatically captured data (email, student ID, optional screenshot).
        *   Send this package as an email *from* the application's Google Service Account address.
        *   **Requires:** The Service Account must have Domain-Wide Delegation enabled in Google Workspace Admin with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` scope authorized.
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK5: Configurable Recipient:** Read the target email address for receiving feedback from cell `B4` of the designated configuration Google Sheet.
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK6: User Confirmation:** Provide visual confirmation to the user that their feedback has been sent successfully (e.g., a success message or toast notification). Handle potential sending errors gracefully.
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK7: Fallback Email Configuration:** 
        *   Implement a fallback mechanism for feedback recipient email via environment variables.
        *   If the email address retrieved from the Google Sheet is invalid (not a proper email format), use the `FEEDBACK_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` environment variable as a fallback.
        *   Log appropriate error messages when falling back to the environment variable.
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK8: Modal Screenshot Exclusion:** 
        *   When capturing a screenshot for feedback, exclude the feedback modal itself from the screenshot to prevent visual recursion.
        *   Temporarily hide the feedback modal during screenshot capture, then restore it.
    *   **FR_FEEDBACK9: Submission State Management:** 
        *   Hide or disable form buttons (Submit and Cancel) after successful submission until the modal closes.
        *   Display a success message to indicate successful submission.
        *   Close the feedback modal automatically after a short delay (2 seconds) following successful submission.

*   **AI-Assisted GPA Targeting:**
    *   **FR_AI1: AI-Powered GPA and Credit Recommendations:** 
        *   Integrate an AI engine to analyze a student's current academic standing and provide personalized recommendations for:
            * Optimal target semester GPA to achieve
            * Number of credits (both total and major-specific) to register for
            * Tailored strategies based on academic standing (e.g., avoid probation, improve GPA)
    
    *   **FR_AI2: AI Integration Approach:**
        *   **Integration Pattern:** Implement a client-to-API architecture where the GPA calculator frontend prepares and sends contextual data to an AI service endpoint.
        *   **AI Service Selection:** Use a Large Language Model service (e.g., OpenAI API, Azure OpenAI, or another suitable provider) capable of analyzing structured data and providing reasoning-based recommendations.
        *   **Performance Requirements:** The AI service should respond within 2-3 seconds to maintain user engagement.
    
    *   **FR_AI3: Data Inputs for AI Prompting:**
        *   **Student Academic Profile:**
            * Current cumulative overall GPA and credits
            * Current cumulative major GPA and credits
            * Probation threshold GPA value (retrieved from configuration)
            * Academic standing status (if available)
            * Major/department information

            * BU's GPA calculation rules summary
            * Credit requirements for good standing
            * Maximum credit load per semester allowed
            * Repeat course policies
        *   **Analysis Goals:**
            * Avoid probation (if current GPA is near threshold)
            * Reach next meaningful GPA milestone
            * Optimize credit load for GPA improvement
    
    *   **FR_AI4: Output Requirements:**
        *   **Recommendation Format:**
            * Target Semester GPA: A specific, achievable GPA value expressed to three decimal places
            * Credit Recommendations:
                * Total credits to register for (as a whole number)
                * Breakdown between major and non-major credits
                * Rationale for the recommended credit distribution
            * Strategies:
                * Specific advice on course selection approach
                * Guidance on whether to prioritize major or non-major courses
                * Risk assessment of the recommended path
        *   **Personalization Elements:**
            * Recommendations must be tailored to the student's specific situation
            * Different strategies for students at risk of probation vs. those in good standing
            * Appropriate tone based on the academic situation (supportive for struggling students, encouraging for those doing well)
    
    *   **FR_AI5: User Interface Integration:**
        *   **Access Point:** Provide a clearly visible button labeled "Get AI Recommendations" in the Target GPA section.
        *   **Interface Design:**
            * **Right Panel Layout:** Implement the AI interface in a collapsible panel that slides in from the right side of the screen.
            * **Chatbot Interaction Model:** Design the interface to function like a conversational chatbot with:
                * Chat message bubbles for both system messages and user inputs
                * Visual distinction between AI-generated messages and user queries
                * A message input field at the bottom for follow-up questions
                * Typing indicators when the AI is generating a response
                * Support for multi-turn conversations about academic planning
            * **Persistent Availability:** Allow users to minimize/maximize the chat panel while continuing to use the calculator
        *   **Results Display:**
            * Present AI recommendations in chat message format with structured sections
            * Format numeric recommendations (GPA targets, credit counts) to stand out visually
            * Include a disclaimer about AI-generated content as the first message
            * Provide action buttons within chat messages to:
                * Apply the recommended target GPA values directly to the calculator
                * Ask follow-up questions about specific recommendations
                * Close or minimize the chat panel
        *   **Visual Design:**
            * Use a chat bubble design consistent with modern messaging applications
            * Apply a distinct color scheme that complements but differentiates from the main calculator
            * Include an AI assistant avatar/icon to create a more personalized experience
            * Employ visual formatting (bold text, bullet points, etc.) to improve readability of recommendations
    
    *   **FR_AI6: Planner State Handling:**
        *   **Empty Planner Logic:** If the planner is empty (no courses added yet), the AI should:
            * Focus on recommending a suitable credit load
            * Suggest a credit distribution between major and non-major courses
            * Provide GPA targets based solely on the student's cumulative data
            * Acknowledge the empty planner state in its recommendations
        *   **Pre-Populated Planner Logic:** If the planner contains courses loaded from the database (Google Sheet):
            * Acknowledge that these are the courses the student is currently registered for
            * Explicitly ask if the student is looking to:
                * Modify their current semester registration 
                * Add courses for planning future semesters
                * Evaluate their current registration without changes
            * Adapt recommendations based on whether changes to current registration are feasible
            * Consider institutional deadlines for registration changes in recommendations
        *   **Multi-Semester Planning:** When the student indicates they are planning for future semesters:
            * Ask if the current registered courses should be treated as confirmed
            * Allow students to designate which courses belong to which semester
            * For GPA calculation purposes, provide two calculation modes:
                * Treat all courses as if registered in a single semester (simplified mode)
                * Calculate semester-by-semester progression of GPA (detailed mode)
            * Explain GPA projection differences between these two approaches
        *   **Registration Modification Guidance:** When the student indicates they want to modify current registration:
            * Ask which specific courses they are considering dropping or changing
            * Provide targeted guidance on the GPA impact of these specific changes
            * Include information about registration deadline considerations
            * Note any potential implications for course prerequisites or program requirements
        *   **Interactive Data Collection:** When collecting additional information, the system should:
            * Initiate a guided conversation through the chatbot interface to collect relevant data
            * Ask specific, structured questions to gather information needed for accurate recommendations
            * Present these questions in a conversational format with simple response options where possible
        *   **Required Clarification Questions:**
            * **Registration Status:** "Would you like to modify your current registration, plan for future semesters, or evaluate your current courses?"
            * **Repeat Courses:** "Are you planning to repeat any courses this semester?"
            * **Repeat Course Details:** If yes to repeat courses:
                * "How many courses do you plan to repeat?"
                * "Are these repeat courses part of your major curriculum?"
                * "What were your previous grades in these courses?" (with grade selection options)
            * **Credit Load Preferences:** "Do you prefer to take a full course load or a reduced schedule?"
            * **Major/Non-Major Balance:** "Do you want to focus more on major courses or general requirements?"
            * **GPA Goals:** "Are you trying to improve your GPA, maintain your current standing, or fulfill specific graduation requirements?"
            * **Multi-Semester Planning:** If planning for future:
                * "How many semesters ahead are you planning for?"
                * "Do you want to see GPA projections semester by semester, or as an overall calculation?"
        *   **Data Utilization:**
            * Combine this interactively collected data with the existing student profile information
            * Package all information into a structured format for the AI prompt
            * Reference the collected data explicitly in recommendations to show how it influenced the advice
            * Store responses temporarily for the session to allow for refined recommendations if the user modifies the planner

    *   **FR_AI7: Prompt Engineering and Output Control:**
        *   **Prompt Template:** Develop a structured prompt template with clear instructions and data formatting to ensure consistent AI responses.
        *   **Response Verification:**
            * Validate that numeric values returned by the AI are within reasonable ranges
            * Ensure credit recommendations don't exceed institutional maximums
            * Verify that GPA targets are achievable based on current standings
        *   **Fallback Mechanisms:**
            * Implement error handling for cases where AI recommendations can't be generated
            * Provide pre-defined guidance if the AI service is unavailable
    
    *   **FR_AI8: Institutional Constraints and Rules:**
        *   **Academic Policies:** Ensure the AI is informed about:
            * Minimum GPA requirements for good academic standing (2.0 or as configured)
            * Credit load limitations (minimum and maximum)
            * Program-specific requirements if available
        *   **Calculation Alignment:** AI recommendations must align with the same GPA calculation logic used in the core calculator.
    
    *   **FR_AI9: Privacy and Data Handling:**
        *   **Data Minimization:** Only send necessary, de-identified information to the AI service.
        *   **No Persistent Storage:** AI interactions should not persist student data beyond the session.
        *   **Consent Mechanism:** Inform users that their academic data will be processed by an AI service and obtain appropriate consent.
        *   **Compliance:** Ensure all AI processing complies with relevant education data privacy regulations.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **NFR1: Accuracy:** Calculations must precisely implement BU rules.

*   **NFR13: Space Efficiency:** UI design must maximize information density while maintaining readability, with special focus on reducing vertical scrolling on mobile devices.
*   **NFR14: Data Format Consistency:** All GPA values must be displayed with exactly three decimal places, and all credit values must be displayed as whole numbers.

**6. Data Requirements**

*   **Input Source (Google Sheets):** Document ID, Service Account Credentials. Sheet Names (`Students`, `registration`, `Gradescale`) and specified Columns.
*   **Configuration Data:** Dynamically loaded from `Gradescale`. External text for Disclaimer.
*   **User Input (Session):** Edits within planner table, Target GPA values (default 2.0).
*   **Calculated Outputs:** Current Cum GPA, Semester Planner GPA, Projected Cum GPA, Required Semester GPA/Points Needed.

**7. Key Assumptions**

*   Google Sheets are accurate, maintained, and reflect BU policy.
*   `Students` sheet data reflects past repeats correctly up to its last update.
*   `Gradescale.Note` field reliably identifies non-GPA grades via "Not Calcualted in GPA".
*   WF grade configured as F in `Gradescale`.
*   Points/10 rule applies ONLY to base cumulative points from `Students` sheet.
*   Users provide correct inputs where required (Previous Grade, Original Major for P-Repeat).
*   **Target GPA Logic (v34):** Divisor includes credits for Blank grades or GPA-Affecting grades from relevant planner courses; Base points adjusted for points from ALL replaced GPA-affecting grades; Base credits adjusted ONLY for credits from P-repeat replaced grades; Net credits added only by non-repeats.
*   Student Not Found handling (0 base, no repeats) is acceptable.
*   Ignoring `RegGrade` not in `Gradescale` (leave planner grade blank) is acceptable.
*   `Gradescale` changes infrequently (refresh on app start/infrequently is okay).
*   Mobile users value compact, space-efficient layouts to minimize scrolling while accessing all functionality.

**8. UI/UX Implementation Details**

*   **Combined GPA Results Display:**
    *   A single card/box that contains both Semester and Projected GPA information

    *   Consistent color coding: green for Semester GPAs, blue for Projected GPAs
    *   Compact typography with appropriately sized headings and clear hierarchy
    *   Includes succinct explanatory text for each section

*   **Mobile Course Entry Layout:**
    *   Grid-based layout that organizes course information horizontally where possible
    *   Top row: Course ID, Credits, Grade selector in a space-efficient grid
    *   Second row: Major/Repeat checkboxes and remove button
    *   Previous Grade selector appears conditionally only when Repeat is checked
    *   Reduced padding and spacing between elements while maintaining touch targets
    *   Smaller but readable font sizes for labels and values

*   **GPA Results Card Implementation:**
    *   Tab-based interface with three sections (Semester, Projected, Target) for efficient space usage
    *   Consistent formatting for all GPA values (3 decimal places) and credit values (whole numbers)
    *   Dynamic footers for each tab that cross-reference relevant GPA information:
        * Semester tab shows Projected and Target GPAs in footer
        * Projected tab shows Semester and Target GPAs in footer
        * Target tab shows Semester and Projected GPAs in footer
    *   Visual indicators for negative values (red text) and values above 4.0 (warning message)
    *   Target tab includes detailed credit information under each required GPA: "Based on X semester credits and Y total credits"
    *   Context-appropriate warning messages that prioritize impossible GPA notifications over credits issues

This document should now be a stable reference point capturing the full requirements and logic as discussed, including the latest UI optimization changes and GPA display formatting requirements.

**9. Build Versioning System**

*   **FR_BUILD1: Automatic Version Incrementing:**
    *   The application uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for tracking changes
    *   The system automatically increments the PATCH version number (x.y.Z) when:
        * The application is built for production via the `prebuild` npm script (when SKIP_VERSION_INCREMENT is not set to 'true')
        * A developer manually runs the version update script
        * A developer uses the provided `prepush` script before pushing to the repository
    *   Version numbers are managed in multiple locations to ensure consistency:
        * `package.json` file (primary source of version)
        * `Requirements` file (updated automatically to match package.json)
        * Environment variables for client and server access

*   **FR_BUILD2: Build Information Tracking:**
    *   The following information is captured with each build:
        * Build version number (e.g., 0.1.2)
        * Build date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
        * Commit hash from Git (short form)
    *   This information is stored in environment variables:
        * Server-side: `BUILD_NUMBER`, `BUILD_DATE`, `COMMIT_HASH`
        * Client-side: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_NUMBER`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_DATE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMIT_HASH`

*   **FR_BUILD3: Version Display:**
    *   The application displays the current version number and build date in the footer of every page
    *   The version display includes:
        * Version number from package.json
        * Build date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    *   The version information is displayed in small, unobtrusive text that doesn't interfere with the primary functionality

*   **FR_BUILD4: Development Tooling:**
    *   Automated scripts to support version management:
        * `update-build-number.js`: Increments the patch version and updates all relevant files
        * `prepare-version-commit.js`: Stages changed files and prepares them for Git commit
    *   NPM scripts to streamline the process:
        * `npm run update-version`: Manually update version numbers
        * `npm run prepush`: Update version and prepare for Git push
        * `prebuild` (automatic): Update version before production builds

*   **FR_BUILD5: Build Data Access:**
    *   Build information is accessible throughout the application via:
        * Environment variables in server-side code
        * `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed environment variables in client-side code
        * A dedicated `buildInfo.ts` module that handles environment differences
    *   The system handles hydration differences between server and client environments to prevent React errors

*   **FR_BUILD6: Version Consistency Between Environments:**
    *   The application maintains version consistency between development and production environments:
        * In development: Version increments only when developers explicitly run version update scripts
        * In Vercel deployments: Version remains unchanged during builds via the SKIP_VERSION_INCREMENT=true flag
    *   Regular git commits do NOT automatically change the version number
    *   The commit hash is always updated regardless of version increment status
    *   Specific commands for version management:
        * `npm run update-version`: Updates version number without committing changes
        * `npm run prepush`: Updates version number AND creates a commit with message "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
        * Regular `git commit` and `git push` commands: Do NOT affect version numbers

*   **FR_BUILD7: Version Management Process:**
    *   **For routine code changes:**
        1. Make code changes
        2. Use standard `git commit` and `git push` commands
        3. Version number remains unchanged
        4. Commit hash updates in environment variables on next build
    *   **For version increments:**
        1. Make code changes
        2. Run `npm run prepush` to increment version and create a commit
        3. Run `git push` to push changes to remote repository
        4. Vercel builds with the new version number
    *   **For manual version control:**
        1. Make code changes and commit them
        2. Run `npm run update-version` to increment version without committing
        3. Manually commit the version changes
        4. Push all changes to the remote repository

**11. Development Workflow for AI Feature Integration**

*   **Branching Strategy:**
    *   **FR_DEV1: Production Stability:**
        *   Maintain the `main` branch as the stable, production-ready version
        *   All bug fixes and minor improvements continue on this branch
        *   Production deployments are made exclusively from the `main` branch
    
    *   **FR_DEV2: Feature Branch for AI Development:**
        *   Create a dedicated `feature/ai-recommendations` branch for AI functionality development
        *   Branch should be created from a stable point in the `main` branch
        *   Command reference: `git checkout -b feature/ai-recommendations`
    
    *   **FR_DEV3: Parallel Development Workflow:**
        *   **Main Branch Work:**
            * Bug fixes and critical updates continue on `main`
            * Each fix should be properly committed with descriptive messages
            * Regular deployments to production can continue uninterrupted
        *   **Feature Branch Work:**
            * AI recommendations feature development proceeds independently
            * All new AI-related code remains isolated from production
            * Regular commits document the feature development progress
    
    *   **FR_DEV4: Branch Synchronization:**
        *   Periodically merge changes from `main` into the feature branch:
            * `git checkout feature/ai-recommendations`
            * `git merge main`
        *   Resolve any merge conflicts to keep the feature branch updated
        *   This ensures the feature branch includes all bug fixes and improvements
    
    *   **FR_DEV5: Feature Completion and Integration:**
        *   When AI features are complete and tested:
            1. Create a pull request from `feature/ai-recommendations` to `main`
            2. Conduct thorough code review and testing
            3. Merge the feature branch into `main` when approved
            4. Deploy the updated `main` branch to production
    
    *   **FR_DEV6: Branch Management:**
        *   Retain the feature branch until the AI functionality is stable in production
        *   Consider creating version tags at significant development milestones
        *   Document branch purpose and status in repository documentation

*   **Benefits of this Development Approach:**
    *   Isolates experimental AI code from production systems
    *   Enables simultaneous bug fixing and feature development
    *   Provides clear separation of concerns between maintenance and new features
    *   Allows for thorough testing of AI features before production deployment
    *   Maintains a consistent release cadence for critical updates

**12. AI Feature Access Control**

*   **FR_ACCESS1: User-Level AI Feature Permissions:**
    *   **FR_ACCESS1.1: Permission Configuration:**
        *   AI feature availability is controlled via a dedicated `UseAI` column (column F) in the Access spreadsheet
        *   Values in this column determine whether a user can access AI features:
            * "Yes" - User has permission to use AI features
            * Any other value or empty - User does not have permission to use AI features
        *   This permission is independent of other access control mechanisms (student access, faculty access, etc.)
    
    *   **FR_ACCESS1.2: Permission Checking Logic:**
        *   The system checks for AI permissions in the same Access sheet used for student access control
        *   Permissions are evaluated for each user email when they log in to the system
        *   The `canUseAI` flag is initialized as `false` by default and set to `true` only when explicit permission is granted
        *   Permission checking is implemented with precedence handling to ensure proper evaluation when users have multiple access entries
    
    *   **FR_ACCESS1.3: Integration with Other Access Controls:**
        *   The AI permission check is integrated with existing access control mechanisms
        *   For users with `AccessAllStudents=Yes` privilege, the system ensures AI permissions are still evaluated
        *   Early returns in access checking logic preserve the `canUseAI` permission state
        *   Permission checking is performed for all users regardless of their access level or role

*   **FR_ACCESS2: Frontend Integration:**
    *   **FR_ACCESS2.1: Permission Propagation:**
        *   The `canUseAI` permission flag is passed from backend to frontend as part of the user session data
        *   This flag controls the visibility of AI-related UI elements throughout the application
        *   The permission state is maintained across page refreshes and navigation
    
    *   **FR_ACCESS2.2: Conditional UI Rendering:**
        *   The AI button is only visible to users with the `canUseAI` permission
        *   The entire AI interface is hidden from users without permission
        *   No AI-related functionality is accessible without the proper permission
    
    *   **FR_ACCESS2.3: Access Type Standardization:**
        *   The system standardizes access types returned to the frontend to ensure consistent UI rendering
        *   Valid access types are limited to "direct", "advisor", or "none"
        *   The system ensures the correct access type is returned based on user permissions and available students
